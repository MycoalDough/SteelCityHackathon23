ideas:
 -add health monitoring (virus monitoring, heart rate, etc)
 -hunters that see prey that are low HP are bound to attack them more than other prey
 -viruses will have a code (0-500) - prey can develop t-cells every 10 seconds that have a random code (0-500)
  -if not activated within 1 minute by a dendritic cell, the t-cell is destroyed 
  -if activated, then it stays alive for permanent immunity
  -easiest way to irradicate a disease from your body
  -memory t-cells are transfered across generations for easier access
